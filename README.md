# HELLCAT Practical Initial Access Guide for Red Teams
This guide is a modified version of an original playbook exclusively used by the HELLCAT ransomware group. The original material was written from an offensive, threat actor perspective, detailing real-world attack methodologies.

This version has been restructured for ethical red team education, with all techniques presented strictly for security research purposes. It covers the full attack lifecycle: reconnaissance, exploitation, C2 infrastructure, lateral movement, persistence, evasion techniques, and includes real-world case studies (including walkthroughs of the Pinger.com and Indonesian government breaches).
